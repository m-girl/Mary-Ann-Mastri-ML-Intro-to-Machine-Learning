# Classic Machine Learning – First GitHub File

## Overview
This repository marks the beginning of my journey into machine learning using GitHub. The file `hello_ml.txt` is my first uploaded artifact for the Classic Machine Learning course, serving as a simple milestone to confirm my GitHub setup and version control workflow.

## File Description
- `A01 My first github repository link and photo.docx`: A Word document containing a brief message to document the start of my GitHub-based coursework.

## Purpose
This file was created to:
- Verify my ability to upload and commit files to GitHub
- Establish a working repository for future machine learning labs and assignments
- Practice basic version control operations such as file creation, commit messaging, and repository organization

## Next Steps
- Add folders for Labs and Assignments
- Upload `.ipynb` notebooks for each module
- Document each lab and assignment with a structured `README.md`
- Continue building a professional portfolio of machine learning work
