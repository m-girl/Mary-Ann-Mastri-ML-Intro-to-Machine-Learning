# **Lab 2 – Comprehensive Machine Learning Practice (Modules 1–10)**

## **Overview**
Lab 2 served as a comprehensive, hands‑on tutorial that combined key concepts from Modules 1 through 10. This lab allowed me to apply a wide range of machine learning skills in one place, reinforcing everything learned so far. I worked through data handling, visualization, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and interpretation using real datasets and multiple ML techniques.

This lab functioned as a “mini‑capstone” for the first half of the course, giving me the opportunity to practice the full machine learning workflow from start to finish.

## **Objectives**
By completing this lab, I strengthened my ability to:

- Work confidently with Jupyter notebooks and Python ML libraries  
- Load, explore, and preprocess datasets  
- Apply visualization techniques to understand data patterns  
- Use supervised and unsupervised learning methods  
- Train, test, and compare multiple machine learning models  
- Interpret model performance using metrics and visual tools  
- Apply best practices from the ML workflow across different problem types  
- Combine skills from earlier modules into a single, cohesive project  


## **Topics Covered (Modules 1–10 Integration)**

### ✅ **Module 1–2: Python, Jupyter, and Data Handling**
- Importing libraries  
- Working with pandas DataFrames  
- Cleaning and inspecting data  

### ✅ **Module 3–4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Summary statistics  
- Visualizations (histograms, scatterplots, heatmaps)  
- Identifying patterns and correlations  

### ✅ **Module 5–6: Supervised Learning**
- Classification and regression concepts  
- Training models using scikit‑learn  
- Splitting data into training/testing sets  

### ✅ **Module 7: Model Evaluation**
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1‑score  
- Confusion matrices  
- Comparing multiple models  

### ✅ **Module 8: Feature Engineering**
- Selecting relevant features  
- Understanding how features impact model performance  

### ✅ **Module 9: Unsupervised Learning (if applicable)**
- Clustering or dimensionality reduction  
- Understanding unlabeled data  

### ✅ **Module 10: Putting It All Together**
- Applying the full ML workflow  
- Documenting insights and results  
- Reflecting on model performance  


## **What I Did in This Lab**
- Loaded and explored a dataset  
- Cleaned and prepared the data for modeling  
- Visualized key features and relationships  
- Selected features for training  
- Built multiple machine learning models  
- Evaluated and compared model performance  
- Interpreted results using metrics and visual tools  
- Reflected on what worked well and what could be improved  

This lab emphasized *process*, not perfection — the goal was to practice the full workflow and reinforce concepts from earlier modules.


## **Key Learnings**
- Machine learning is most effective when approached as a structured workflow  
- Visualization is essential for understanding data before modeling  
- Different models perform differently depending on the dataset and features  
- Evaluation metrics provide deeper insight than accuracy alone  
- Feature selection can significantly improve model performance  
- Combining skills from multiple modules builds confidence and fluency  


## **Challenges I Faced**
- Choosing the right features for the models  
- Interpreting evaluation metrics across different algorithms  
- Understanding how preprocessing affects model performance  
- Managing the complexity of integrating many concepts into one notebook  

## **Reflection**
This lab helped me see how all the pieces of machine learning fit together. It reinforced the importance of:

- Clean data  
- Thoughtful feature selection  
- Testing multiple models  
- Evaluating results with more than one metric  
- Documenting insights clearly  

I now feel more confident applying the ML workflow to new datasets and problems.

## **Summary**
Lab 2 was a comprehensive, multi‑module practice lab that brought together everything learned from Modules 1–10. It strengthened my understanding of the machine learning workflow and gave me hands‑on experience applying multiple techniques in a single project. This lab serves as an important milestone in my ML learning journey.
